Description:

You can have 9 email accounts all at once, but there's still something so wonderfully refreshing about getting an envelope addressed to you in the mail. On the other hand, email is just so damn convenient. That's where our app comes in.

PostPushr combines postal delivery and cloud printing in one simplified service for general personal use. Bid farewell to fumbling through cluttered drawers for stamps and making errant stops at the post office. With PostPushr, all you have to do is open up your email, type your message in the body, and hit send. BOOM! With the power of Lob, Sendgrid, Stripe, Google Maps, MongoDB, and NameCheap, your email will end up as a letter in your recipient's mailbox!

Imagine: you're here at MHacks and left your spouse/partner/significant other back at home. How romantic it would be to send them a love letter, from amidst the chaos of sleep deprivation and junk food galore, without having to brave the cold and walk to a post office! But if that prospect left you swooning, check out the second part of our project!
